 thoroughly analyze this codebase and create a plan optimized for Software Developing LLM agents to remodel and redesign this project with a focus on upgrading the tech stack to a bleeding edge level of trending technologies.

all plans should be stored at a directory you will create at ./plans and organised based on human based or llm based, 

The frontend should also be professionally made and creatively inspired using these websites as references:

graffico.it: https://graffico.it/
AVA SRG: https://srg.ava-digital.site/en
https://edwinle.com/work/centraal-beheer

All inspiring and creative portfolio websites make use of their technology stack, style, design philosophies and code design in this upgrade.

create two plans with parallel sets of tasks for concurrent agent use.

This plan should set in multiple phases and starts in RESEARCH phase: 
- RESEARCH phase, through using a the website reference and deep web search for tech stack research, coding information, designs, frameworks, other relevant information, web scraping is allowed. Create a log of this attempt and send to user.
- DESIGN phase where the research gained from the research phase is broke down into detailed plans and Software Engineering Diagrams. Providing one human based response and two others for parallel agent use. Create a log of this attempt and send to user.
- BUILD phase proceeds to use the DESIGN phase results to concurrently build the project exceeding the tasks set by the DESIGN plans. Create a log of this attempt and send to user.
- REFLECT Ran by one agent. compare newly built project to the reference websites. If they match the qualities and level of design of the websites continue to TEST phase. Otherwise move to REFINE phase. Create a log of this attempt and send to user.
- REFINE is ran by one agent. The purpose of this phase is to take the context from the REFLECT phase to improve on its design. Create a log of this attempt and send to user. 
- TEST/DEBUG is ran by one agent. add test cases and debug the entire application. Interact with the entire page, make sure all things work as expected. Observe the webpage when debugging to ensure all animations and events trigger successfully. If the website is not performing and operating perfectly then repeat cycle otherwise continue to PRE-RELEASE.
- PRE-RELEASE, one agent. create the plan for deployment using Vercel, adding CI/CD implementation to deploy the project securely, succesfully and smoothly.
- RELEASE, one agent, using your guidance create a guide.md file with steps on setting up the project with Vercel to display my new portfolio publicly
